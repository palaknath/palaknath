- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Palak Nath, a masters student in Business Analytics at UIUC
- I am an IT engineer from Delhi, India who fell in love with Analytics in my final year of Engineering, and ever since there has been no looking back. Probably, one of the youngest in the Gies graduate programs, I have had 6 months of experience with ZS Associates as a Software Performance Engineer. I have had the experience to work on a lot of Big Data and Predictive Analytics projects throughout my bachelor's and otherwise. In the future, I wish to advance into roles that combine both technical as well as managerial skills like business analyst, data analyst, or pricing analyst.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Visualisation, Artifitial Intelligence, Predictive Analytics and Consumer analytics
