### 👋 Hi Everyone, I am Palak Nath

Currently working as a Data Scientist at Comscore, I am an IT engineer who fell in love with Analytics in my final year of Engineering, and ever since there has been no looking back.
Thriving at the intersection of data and digital media, my role at Comscore harnesses SQL, Python/R, and ETL tools to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. Our team's collaborative efforts in data quality and automation streamline processes for our clients, reflecting a commitment to excellence and innovation.

I have a master's degree in Business Analytics from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. My analytical prowess is complemented by a perfect GPA and multiple leadership accolades. 

Before my masters, I was working with ZS Associates as a Software Performance Engineer. I have had the experience to work on a lot of Big Data and Predictive Analytics projects throughout my bachelor's and otherwise. In the future, I wish to advance into roles that combine both technical as well as managerial skills like business analyst, data analyst, or pricing analyst.
