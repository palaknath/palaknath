👋 Hi Everyone!

I’m Palak Nath, a masters student in Business Analytics at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

I am an IT engineer from who fell in love with Analytics in my final year of Engineering, and ever since there has been no looking back. Before my masters, I was working with ZS Associates as a Software Performance Engineer. I have had the experience to work on a lot of Big Data and Predictive Analytics projects throughout my bachelor's and otherwise. In the future, I wish to advance into roles that combine both technical as well as managerial skills like business analyst, data analyst, or pricing analyst.

👀 I’m interested in Data Visualisation, Artifitial Intelligence, Business, Predictive and Consumer analytics
👩🏻‍💻 R Programming, Python, Excel, SQL and Tableau
